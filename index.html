            Hello everyone,
            I'm Aron from Fortaleza, Brazil. I enjoy spending time with my family
            and practicing sports. There's a beautiful lake in a nearby park where
            my wife, our daughter, and I love to watch the sunset and admire the
            local wildlife. I find joy in connecting with people from different
            countries, which inspired me to learn English and Japanese. In my free
            time, I also enjoy watching movies and series from the US and Japan.
            I am an avid sports enthusiast, with volleyball and basketball being
            my favorite activities. Currently, I'm studying at Brigham Young University,
            working towards becoming a software developer. Programming is a passion
            of mine, and I'm thrilled to be part of this course, which I believe will
            help me achieve my career goals. Additionally, I love meeting new people
            and am excited to get to know all of you. Let's make this a memorable experience
            together!
