            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 1998 by adventure enthusiast Aron Reis, Rafting began as a small,
                family-operated rafting business with a mission to share the thrill of river
                exploration with others. Sarah, an experienced rafter who had spent years navigating
                some of the world‚Äôs most challenging rivers, wanted to create a company that combined
                his love for adventure with a commitment to safety and environmental stewardship.
                Starting with just two rafts and a handful of local guides, Rafting quickly gained
                a reputation for providing exhilarating and safe rafting experiences.
                As word spread about the company's dedication to high-quality service
                and unforgettable adventures, the business grew. By the early 2000s,
                Rafting had expanded its operations to include a variety of rivers and difficulty
                levels, catering to everyone from beginners to seasoned rafters. Throughout the years,
                Rafting has remained true to its core values of safety, customer satisfaction,
                and environmental sustainability. The company has invested in top-of-the-line
                equipment, rigorous guide training programs, and initiatives to preserve the
                natural beauty of the rivers they operate on. Today, Rafting is a leader
                in the rafting industry, known for its innovative trips, knowledgeable guides,
                and unwavering commitment to providing the best possible experience for its clients.
                As Rafting continues to grow, it remains a family-oriented business that values
                its roots and looks forward to many more years of creating unforgettable adventures
                for rafters of all ages and skill levels.
